            I think its a very good MOBA game. <br> 
            I love it ! Basically, Mobile Legends is a 5v5 MOBA game where you, in a team of 5, <br>
            need to destroy your enemy team's base and it has a variety of heroes. <br>
            Mobile Legends has been here for quite some time and so, <br> 
            it has improved a lot since its first debut. <br>

            training for teamwork, and many more <br>
